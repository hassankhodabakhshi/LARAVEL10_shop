3. **ChatGPT**: Sure! Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to install Laravel 10 using XAMPP and Ubuntu:

Step 1: Install XAMPP
- Download XAMPP for Linux from the Apache Friends website (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the XAMPP installer is located.
- Run the following command to make the installer executable:
  ```
  chmod +x <xampp-installer>.run
  ```
  Replace `<xampp-installer>` with the actual name of the installer file.
- Run the installer using the following command:
  ```
  sudo ./<xampp-installer>.run
  ```
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the XAMPP installation.

Step 2: Install Composer
- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to install Composer.
- Run the following command to download and install Composer:
  ```
  php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
  php composer-setup.php
  php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
  ```
- Move the `composer.phar` file to a globally accessible location by running the following command:
  ```
  sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
  ```

Step 3: Install Laravel
- Open a terminal and navigate to the `htdocs` directory inside the XAMPP installation folder:
  ```
  cd /opt/lampp/htdocs
  ```
- Run the following command to create a new Laravel project:
  ```
  composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel <project-name>
  ```
  Replace `<project-name>` with the desired name for your Laravel project.
- Once the installation is completed, navigate to the project directory:
  ```
  cd <project-name>
  ```
  Replace `<project-name>` with the actual name of your Laravel project.

Step 4: Configure XAMPP
- Open a terminal and run the following command to start the XAMPP server:
  ```
  sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start
  ```
- Open your preferred web browser and visit `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
- Create a new database for your Laravel project.

Step 5: Configure Laravel
- Duplicate the `.env.example` file located in the root directory of your Laravel project and rename it to `.env`:
  ```
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
- Open the `.env` file and modify the following configurations:
  ```
  DB_DATABASE=<your-database-name>
  DB_USERNAME=root
  DB_PASSWORD=
  ```
  Replace `<your-database-name>` with the name of the database you created in Step 4.

Step 6: Run Laravel
- Open a terminal and navigate to your Laravel project directory if you're not already there.
- Run the following command to generate an application key:
  ```
  php artisan key:generate
  ```
- Finally, start the local development server by running the following command:
  ```
  php artisan serve
  ```
- Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000` to see your Laravel application in action.

That's it! You have successfully installed Laravel 10 using XAMPP and Ubuntu. You can now start building your Laravel application.
